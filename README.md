Hello!
My name is Zach Kofoed, and I am currently a junior in college studying Computer Science. I work as a programmer at Adjacency Global Solutions. Over the course of thousands of hours coding, I’ve learned and grown immensely as a developer.

At work, I frequently use SQL, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and PL/B, and I’ve had the opportunity to develop full-stack applications. PL/B, in particular, is a unique challenge—it was created in 1972 and has very limited documentation. When I first encountered it, I had never even heard of the language! Coding in PL/B requires a deep understanding of programming fundamentals, as there are almost no external resources available for guidance. The language feels like a mix of C and assembly, demanding precision and creativity to navigate its complexities.

Working with PL/B has also taught me the value of integrating different technologies. For instance, I’ve used SQL alongside PL/B to create programs that sift through large datasets and log them into SQL databases, resulting in streamlined and easy-to-maintain solutions. Additionally, I’ve gained extensive experience debugging and maintaining legacy code. I’ve deployed hotfixes for software written in the 1980s, serving multi-million-dollar clients, and worked through hundreds of thousands of lines of code to locate and resolve specific issues.

Outside of PL/B, I’ve developed hundreds of client-facing pages using tools like Bootstrap Studio, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring seamless front-end and back-end integration to deliver polished, user-friendly applications.

Beyond my professional work, I’ve also pursued several personal projects to expand my skills and explore my interests. I developed a Yu-Gi-Oh! card-sorting website that allows users to input specific parameters and receive results for all matching cards. I also created a niche tool for the rhythm game osu!, which resizes images to meet the game’s highly specific requirements, hosts them on my server, and provides hotlinks for others to use. Additionally, I have a Flappy Bird game in Python currently in development, showcasing my ability to design interactive applications and games. I am also developing an innovative snake game in PL/B, a significant challenge given that the language was never intended for game design and was originally created for entirely different purposes.
