# AboutMe
Hello!
My name is Zach Kofoed, and I am currently a junior in college studying Computer Science. I work as a programmer at Adjacency Global Solutions. Over the course of thousands of hours coding, I’ve learned and grown immensely as a developer.

At work, I frequently use SQL, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and PL/B, and I’ve had the opportunity to develop full-stack applications. PL/B, in particular, is a unique challenge—it was created in 1972 and has very limited documentation. When I first encountered it, I had never even heard of the language! Coding in PL/B requires a deep understanding of programming fundamentals, as there are almost no external resources available for guidance. The language feels like a mix of C and assembly, demanding precision and creativity to navigate its complexities.

Working with PL/B has given me a deeper understanding of coding, as it lacks built-in functions, requiring me to write everything by hand. This experience has taught me to appreciate the fundamental building blocks of programming. I’ve also integrated SQL into my PL/B programs, developing systems that sift through large amounts of data and log it into SQL databases, creating an efficient and easy-to-maintain solution.

This work has also introduced me to an essential aspect of being a programmer: maintaining and improving legacy code. I’ve deployed hotfixes for programs written in the 1980s used by multi-million-dollar clients, and I’ve sifted through hundreds of thousands of lines of code in a single program to find and fix one problematic line. This process has honed my debugging skills to a high degree.

Beyond PL/B, I’ve developed hundreds of pages for clients, working extensively on the front-end while ensuring seamless communication with the back-end to deliver robust software solutions. I’ve used tools like Bootstrap Studio, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, to create dynamic, user-friendly applications.
